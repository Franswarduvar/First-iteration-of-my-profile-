# First-iteration-of-my-profile-
This is the first iteration of my personal profile, here I will store some of my most impressive projects along with any and all contact information, resumes, and personal achivements.

Over the cousrse of this first iteration of my profile I have added the following things: 
1) Navigation bar
2) Introduction
3) Cotact tab with links to my linkedin, github, email and phone number
4) A personal picture of me

Things to note, the navigation bar does not send the user down the page to the designated location as at this point most of the document can be seen without scrolling. I did change the final product to be differnt then the initial wireframe layout. I belive that as I have more to add and as I learn more it will become closer to the wireframe layout but not identacle. 

Here is an image of the finished product:
